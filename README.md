# Malloc

Toy implementation of the `malloc` `free` and `realloc` functions. It can run some simple external programs such as `ls` `emacs` or `nano`.

## Build & execute

Just run `make`

Then you can execute any binary you want with the `./run.sh <bin>` script which will make the dynamic linker use this malloc implementation.
